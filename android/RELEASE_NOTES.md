**What's new in beta.5**

- Better matching: rejects tribute bands, re-recordings, live albums and other accounts' uploads; checks the Bandcamp file's length against Apple's
- File names and tags use the official spelling from Apple ("kataklysm - black sheep" → `Kataklysm - The Black Sheep.mp3`); songs already saved under the name you typed are still skipped
- A leading "The / A / An" no longer stops a song being found
- **Import .txt** also reads CSV exports (Chosic, Exportify, TuneMyMusic, Soundiiz, Apple Music) and M3U playlists
- Clearer buttons: **Import .txt**, **Chosic website** (Spotify → .txt), **Apple Music** (paste a link)

**First beta of SEVBY for Android** – a proper app (no Termux needed).

Paste or import a `.txt` list of `Artist - Title` lines, pick a folder, press **Start Download**. SEVBY looks for each song on
**Bandcamp** first and uses **YouTube** for the rest, then saves a 128 kbps MP3 with title, artist, album, year,
track number and square cover art (album details from Bandcamp or Apple's iTunes Search).

- Queue several lists; each goes into its own sub-folder
- Pause / Resume / Stop, also from the notification; after Stop, **Resume** carries on where it left off
- Skips songs already in the folder, never makes "(1)" copies, *Retry failed* for the misses
- Update the downloader (yt-dlp) from **About & updates** when YouTube changes – no reinstall needed
- Tells you when a new SEVBY version is out (banner on the main screen and in **About & updates**); one tap downloads it and it installs over the old one, keeping your settings
- **Apple Music**: paste a public Apple Music playlist or album link and SEVBY fills in the song list (no sign-in)
- Got a Spotify playlist? The **Chosic website** button turns it into a song list to paste
- If Bandcamp blocks your connection (some mobile networks and hotspots do), it falls back to YouTube
